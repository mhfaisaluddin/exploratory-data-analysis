# exploratory-data-analysis
This is a project sample based on the assignment at bootcamp class. The assignments are given with the aim of case study and problem solving with python programming about EDA. The dataset and all information about it can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

Specifically, this task aims to carry out standard cleansing, standard EDA, and deep-dive exploration. By performing standard cleansing and standard EDA, we can get some information and insight of the data. From that insight we can perform deep-dive exploration by set the deep-dive question to restrict the scope of analysis to get what exactly we want, and avoid pointless analysis. 

## File Description
There are only two files exclude the README :
- The code .ipnyb, is a jupyter notebook that contain step-by-step performing EDA with deep-dive exploration.
- The dataset .csv, is the dataset that used in the task, and can be downloaded from this repo or the website (for the updated data).
